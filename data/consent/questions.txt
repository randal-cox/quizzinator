Please answer the following questions in relation to pick-up play in general. We would like your opinions even if you have not been involved in pick-up play. You don’t have to respond in reference to your own experiences, but focus on your own opinions.

For the purposes of this study, pick-up play is defined as a scene with a partner you don't know (for example, flogging or getting flogged by somebody you met at a play party).

While some play is more focused on power exchange (Dom/sub) dynamics, we will be focusing on tops/bottoms in this survey.

A top is someone who is doing an action to someone else in a scene, such as spanking them or tying them up.

A bottom is someone who is receiving an action in a scene, such as being spanked or tied up.
