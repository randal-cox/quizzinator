Welcome to the on-line survey

Thank you for participating in our research on patterns of jealousy. The following questions are an extension of a series of experiments that we have been conducting at Arizona State University and Northern Illinois University. Participation is limited to those over the age of eighteen.

All of the responses that we receive will be treated as confidential. Any identifying information will be erased as soon as we receive the data. You will have the opportunity to contact us later and find out the results of our survey knowing that the confidentiality of your particular responses is assured. When you finish the form, you will be taken to a page where we will tell you what we've been finding, and give you the information for how to contact us. Your completion of the form and submission of it will be taken as a sign of your agreement to participate in this study.

It is very important that you answer the questions as honestly as possible. If a question makes you feel uncomfortable, or if you don't understand it, please leave it blank rather than giving an inaccurate answer.
